I'm passionate about fostering a sense of community in kink spaces so that people feel a sense of belonging through sharing the parts of themselves they usually keep shamefully hidden. Learning a new skill like rope is so much easier when you feel good in your own skin and can explore, be playful, and listen to feedback. It's why my logo is a sheetbend: bondage connects us and creates intimacy through vulnerability. I'm an organizer for [Tickle Fest](https://www.tklfest.com/), and I have taught rope classes at kink events, given demonstrations and lessons at private parties, and tutored monogamous couples. I'm gay, polyamorous and I live in Philadelphia. 

Thanks for visiting the site, and feel free to reach out.

Here's a few books that have helped me learn to accept myself and navigate the world:
